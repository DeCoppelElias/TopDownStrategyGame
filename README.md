# Castle Defense
Castle Defense is a topdown strategy game where the goal is to destroy all enemy castles and be the last castle standing.
The main defining game feature is that you can draw the path your troops will follow. If you use this correctly you can evade enemy troops or towers.
You can freely use this code but please mention me. Thank You!
